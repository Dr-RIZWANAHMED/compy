## The latest source programs, library and data files for the book are deposited here and at http://www.faculty.umassd.edu/j.wang/book/
- ## Sep. 2017: Jupyter vpython notebooks (.ipynb) are added next to the standard programs (.py), in addition to the archive containing all  notebooks (Jupyter_vpython/VPython_Programs_ipynb.zip)
- ## Sep. 2017: Updated input() function compatibility between Python 2.xx and 3.xx to affected programs (Original versions can be found in `v1.0` folder). To summarize, all codes (.py and .ipynb) should run under Python 2.7x and 3.xx as follows: 
  - ### .py codes not using VPython: will run in Jupyter (via `load prog_name`) and in a terminal
  - ### .py codes using classic VPython (`visual` installed): will run in Jupyter and in a terminal
  - ### .ipynb codes using Jupyter vpython: will run in Jupyter only 
- ## March 2018: Complete update of all .py programs to Jupyter notebook versions.
  - ### This includes all non-VPython programs and revisons to some Jupyter VPython program, so all programs can be run in dual mode: standard mode (`python program.py`) or in Jupyter notebook.
  - ### Programs using `matplotlib` now utilize the `notebook` backend, enabling users to interactively manipulate plots such as zoom and save in nearly the same way as the standard .py versions run from a terminal. In addition, programs using `matplotlib` animation (Programs 8.1, 10.2, and 11.4) work correctly in Jupyter notebook.
